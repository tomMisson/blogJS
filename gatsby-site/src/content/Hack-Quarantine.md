My god was this a rollercoaster🎢. Ask any of the team involved and they will say the same. **100 hours** we planned this hackathon in. From the moment [Jacklyn Biggin (Jack)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/JackBiggin/) suggested it to actually having a livestream, social media, graphics, publicity, bots, a discord server, a slack server, funding 💰 and anything else you can think of.  

## Why did we do this to ourselves? 🤔

You might be wondering, why did you endure over 600 hours of stress, wake up in the middle of the night on mutiple occasions and spend 9+ hours a day working on this? Truth be told, I wanted something to do. I wanted to make a change to peoples lives, I wanted to do something about COVID-19 because it had affected so many people.  
  
I later would find out that someone close to me would sadly pass from Coronavirus 😔. The thing that shocks me is that COVID-19 did what many thought was unlikely. It shook the most developed parts of the world and is making them fall apart. We have to stick together though and we will get through this.🤝

## Give it your all 💯

For a side project that I didn't know how I could contribute to, to filling my days with tasks to complete and helping push Hack Quarantine forward, I initally was lost and found myself to be doing PR and outreach📣. Something completely outside my comfort zone. Nevertheless, I always try to give something a go! Many thanks to [Tom Goodman](https://twitter.com/TauOmicronMu) and [Will Russell](https://will-russell.com/) for teaching me about how to effectvely bring people in! Overall, we had 3,400 sign up to Hack Quarantine and I can't help but think that some of those people are there because of me 😇.  
  
As well as PR, I ended up being the content manager for the [youtube channel](https://hackquarantine.com/youtube) ▶️ where I spent many... many... many... hours, timestamping, title-ing, adding descriptions and thumbnails and tagging them. Again, not what I thought I would be doing but then again, I didn't know what to expect 💤.  
 
Towards the end, I ended up leading the moderation of submissions and allocation of projects that hadn't submitted for prizes. These are some of the tasks that I ended up getting up to now though but honestly, this wouldn't have been possible without the amazing team of 20+ people who all had a part to play. 🎉 No matter what you do in life though, even if you don't like it, it's always worth giving it your all though. It makes everthing more fun about it and when you have a supportive team around you the work doesn't seem like work. 

## Online hackathons 📌

_To be clear, these are my thoughts in **general** not of any particular experiences_

While Hack Quarantine was the biggest student lead hackathon globally as well as being the first 3 week long hackathon in any [MLH league](https://mlh.io/seasons/eu-2020/events), thats not to say it was without it's troubles. For one, while I understand that a traditional hackathon isn't possible in the circumstances, nothing can beat the feeling of staying up coding through the night and similarly, nothing beats colapsing in a heap post event cursing the events name and promising you'll never do it again 😩, only to miss it and do it all over again. The traditional "IRL" hackathon is an experience that brings me so much happiness and sadly, digital hackathons don't do it for me. 😔
  
I already sit at home till the early hours working on projects, *this for example*, and pushing hackathons online don't have the same effect. There's a clear disconnect between the community because as hard as I have tried, it is harder in every way to create a community, to show off projects and to ultimately provide you with the experience of meeting new people, talking to sponsors and raiding the snack table when you are on the _6th_ hour of not having a project.

I look forward to when things return to normal so I can meet with friendos, share colins and appreciate Scotch with the best team I have worked with to date and to also be able to take part in hackathons like //Slash in Berlin and other "IRL" hackathons. 

  
  
Happy hacking folks, 
Tom
