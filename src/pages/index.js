      <h1>Hey everyone! <span role="img" aria-label="waving emoji">👋</span></h1>
      <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet!<span role="img" aria-label="world emoji">🌎</span> This page will detail hacks and bodges I have done with tech, travel, food and drink and just about anything else under the sun that I want to write about. </p>
      <p>Before I start, let me claify the naming of the site, before you have any misconceptions <span role="img" aria-label="face with monacle emoji">🧐</span>... One, see whisky/gin posts for my appreciation behind drinks. Two, my hackathon experience has driven me to <strong>ALWAYS</strong> say something is powered by something if its remotely contributing to it, aswell as ending things in athon, prefixing with hack. Hence the really awful name that is very likely subject to change.</p>
      <p>I also say everyone in the title but I don't know who will be reading this <span role="img" aria-label="thinking emoji">🤔</span> This was mainly meant as a form of commiting things that I find intresting or bizzare that I want to talk about to paper <span role="img" aria-label="memo emoji">📝</span> (well, a markdown file that is interpereted...) and be able to refer people to my thoughts through the internet.  </p>
