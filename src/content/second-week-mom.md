## Recap 🔍

So last week, I started talking about where I am working and discussing the company and their awesome culture, this week I found out that everyone in the company has been sent a suprise goody box 🎁(I'm still awaiting deleivery of mine but will report when I have it) but I think that the thought behind sending these out to employees is really awesome and shows that they care 😍 about their employees which makes me really happy that I am a part of this. 

I also talked about the team and how awesome and supportive they have been. This week it has been more true than ever and I have had some really valuable lessons about creating new code for legacy systems. 👴

## This week 📆

So this week has been an **intense** week 😅, I have had less meetings this week and yet I have been more busyt than last week because I have actually been writing code. The code that was in QA last week: one thing passed 🎉 and is now `Pending deployment` which means it will be going out in the next website release and the other thing failed. 

As much as it sucked that my code failed QA, it isn't a bad thing that it did. I was unaware that you could have multipul messages 💬 with one order so therefor my code worked for on message but for the others, it didn't. It does knock your confidence a bit but its how you respond to that that makes you a better developer 👍. By Friday, I had a fix for this change and had also pushed another thing to be reviewed.  

You could say I have learnt a lot from that experience.

To finish off the week, aswell as getting all the LIVE tickets done that were assigned to me before I move on to the work on the brand sites, I found out that the orignal plan for me in these first 2 weeks was for me to shadow 👻 Joao and see how LIVE development works, instead, I have been doing tickets with some help but otherwise been cracking on. I found out some of the devs that are there currently didn't touch any live work until 6 months in. So I mean no wonder I was stressed. 😂

## What I have learnt 👨‍🏫

As I have said, this week has been challanging. It has been mentally exhausting 🥱 and I dare say because I took on a lot all at once. I got asked to attend meetings that had no impact to what I am doing or going to be doing. So to any new developers starting a job, in your second week, look out for: 

- *Not overloading yourself with too much*
- *Understand that failure is a part of success and that you have to itterate to build amazing.*
- _**Remeber**: you were hired for a reason! You will never be perfect to start off with but it's how you grow with the company that determines your value to them_ 💎


## Goals for next week 🥅

My personal goals for next week after reflecting on this past week are to: 

* I want to set out a clear set of goals with my line managers to be able to track my progress and make sure they're happy with what I am doing. 
* I am going to try to say no to unimportant meetings and understand the value behind my time. 
* I am also going to try and be critical with my review of the code I am writing and questioning efficency as I am learning that with C# there are a **lot** of really cool things that you can do with LINQ and T classes. 

Well, with all that said, I'll keep you posted on how it is going at 30 days in!

Thanks for reading

Tom 🎉
