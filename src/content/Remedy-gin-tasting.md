## Overview
[Remedy Southport](https://remedysouthport.co.uk/) is a Gin and Whisky bar in the town where my parents currently live. 🏠 I work there from time to time and it has an amazing atmosphere with amazing members of staff.  

The Remedy Gin tasting on the 7th of May was the first of it's kind for Remedy. Necessitated by the lack of social interaction 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 people were having due to the Coronavirus (being in a hospitality industry we are very sociable people), the idea was to bring those together through the common love of gin, something that I am personally a huge fan of! ❤️

Led by Sarah Simcock and Susannah Porter (the owners of Remedy) and featured 4 gins, 3 tonics and a set of garnish's 🍋(Citrus, peppercorns and thyme) and also had 2 guest speakers from [Two Birds distillery](https://www.twobirdsspirits.co.uk/home) and [Isle of Skye distillery](https://www.isleofskyedistillers.com/), both make exceptionally good gin🍸.   

I found the structure of the tasting a little chaotic due to there being the spirits with 3 tonics and the garnish's with no real guidance as to what combination would work best together 😬. Obviously, this is a personal thing and you can make it however you want to but this being a tasting, I would have expected a recommendation. While this was the case from the guest speakers, there wasn't any recommendation or guidance for the other two. 🤓

## The gin (the stuff we're all here for)!

So, the gins we had were tasted in the order they are in below 👇 there are also links on where to buy the gins (the titles). They are affilliate links but I have also linked to the distillery site so you can support them directly. 

### [Misty Isle Gin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073FLRYVF/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tommisson1-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B073FLRYVF&linkId=ec7d8107d37298b985fbde647b4d373a)

A heavy juniper and citrus gin that pairs amazingly with orange peel 🍊 made on the Isle of Skye. Misty Isle has won so many awards and you can see why. They have nailed the balance of citrus with other botanicals. A complex gin with a smooth dry aftertaste that is refreshing and light when mixed with Mediterranean tonic but is also very drinkable neat. I 💯% recommend.

### [Didsbury Gin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07RNY6P1F/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B07RNY6P1F&linkCode=as2&tag=tommisson1-21&linkId=679825e310db74393ecdea9ff8cfc72d)

Being Manchester born and being a student at MMU (Manchester Metropolitan University) I am very much bias when it comes to Manchester 🏙️. Three rivers gin also originates from Manchester and while I haven't had the privilage of tasting that, I can tell you that Didsbury gin is trying to be the cooler younger cousin. Another citrus forward gin that pairs great with lime and peppercorns and a Fevertree tonic. [Find out more](https://didsburygin.com/)

### [Hendricks lunar](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B084QVN582/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tommisson1-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B084QVN582&linkId=9822c40b8ef3dd8cca624e47a370e12e)

Everyone knows Hendricks gin, cucumber 🥒 or peppercorns and rosemary but this is something a little _more unusual_ and thats impressive for a company who "invites you to escape the conventional". I am a fan of the original Hendrics but their Lunar 🌙 is beautifully different. Crisp, sharp but not unpleaseant and simply delectable. I will definately be picking up a bottle!

### [Two Birds Pink Grapefruit & Pomegranate Gin](https://www.masterofmalt.com/gin/two-birds/two-birds-pink-grapefruit-and-pomegranate-gin/)

Many thanks to our guest speaker from Two birds (I am really sorry, I forgot your name). A really knowlegable bloke who shared his love for the two birds brand and gin in general. A very sweet, snappy gin that was full of pink citrus flavours. I am not much of fruity gin person (prefering a more savory gin) but this was a really good gin. Two Birds do so many good gins and vodkas which I will have to try. [Find out more and see their full range](https://www.twobirdsspirits.co.uk/)

### All in all...
A great first time tasting from a great bunch of friendly faces! Some real passion for the taste of gin but some further background for the Didsbury gin and Hendricks gin would have made it a brilliant tasting in my opinion. Thank you so much for the great selection of gins though 😍. All of the selected gins were really tasty and I wasn't disappointed at all. Would definitely attend another Remedy tasting though and would recommend 👍 it to anyone wanting to try a selection of gins. 

Thanks for reading!
