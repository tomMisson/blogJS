desc: Yep you heard me, I ACTUALLY use chromeOS non-ironically and now attend hackathons with just a chromebook. A £180 chromebook can do just about anything you want.

I originally meant for this to be my first post and being honest, this is the reason I made this blog because I found myself making the point about chromeOS **NOT** being as bad. So let me present to you my thesis on why ChromeOS ain't that bad. 

## What  is chromeOS and why the 🤬 do you use it?

So for those who don't know, chromeOS is a "operating system" made by Google and designed for chromebooks. I say "operating system" very loosely though as I have been told **many** times that I am wrong ❌ to call it an operating system as it is literally just Google chrome with a nav bar.   

Pitched at students 📚, the chromebook is great for note taking 📝, web browsing 🌐 and overall being so cheap that if you were to destroy it, getting a new one wouldn't be _that much of an issue_. 

Me being a student, and needing a note-taking device for uni, I bought [this chromebook](https://amzn.to/3cNTl6c) for £180 💸 and also got a Chromecast with it. Deal! And it worked for what I needed.

## The ascension to using ChromeOS for everything 👿

Here I am, sorted for how I am going to take notes but when it came to hackathons, I was having to take 2 laptops 💻 and it was just a hassle. I needed a way to program on a chromebook. My original idea, duel booking. Issues with that, the NVMe SSD 💾 in the chromebook is 16Gb so I wasn't going to get another operating system on there and also ChromeOS is **extreamly** locked down 🔒 to the point where you have to enable a legacy mode to enter the bios to change boot priority. _Not ideal if you ask me_.

Amazingly, Google did something great and enabled access to a really stripped back version of the Linux kernel that runs the OS, basically allowing installation of Debian versions of applications. Basically, to cut a long story short, Visual Studio and Node and Docker 🐳 installed later and I can run almost anything I want to on a Chromebook! 

## Serverless computing 🖥

So with all that hassle, it begs the question, what about things like Azure, AWS and Google Cloud ☁. The idea of having a machine in the cloud that you can access a terminal for through a web interface. It's a great point but I am not wanting to spin up a VM each time I want to do some development work. I do love serverless compting though and find myself using things like Blob storage 💧 and cloud based document storage.

## Going forward living with a Chromebook

So while all this is going on, ChromeOS has **defiantly** improved since I first 'broke' ChromeOS and it's a lot cooler 😎

- Install Android apps on ChromeOS
- The Google Assistant is now available
- Closer mobile phone tethering for hotspot sharing with Android phones and lots more.

So overall, living with a Chromebook as my only machine is a lot easier than you might think and if you need something more powerful then sure but don,t go spending 💰💰💰 on a high end chromebook and if you can't hack using a terminal then sure, get a Windows laptop but I am gonna stay in my corner with my chromebook.

Happy Hacking!
