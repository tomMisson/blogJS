## 💎 Recap! 

So when I last posted, I had a crazy week, I needed to get lots of things sorted and overall, my head was all over the place. This time however, things are different. I am in the window of my 1 bed studio flat in Brighton near Seven Dials🧭, typng this on my work laptop, breathing in the fresh sea air and sipping on a G&T 🍸.

I have had chats with my line manager and my report, I have planned out a lot of my year long project that I am about to embark on and it's been one hell of an experience. 

## 🥅 Revisiting my goals

So, incase you forgot, I have included my goal from last time below:

* ✔ I want to set out a clear set of goals with my line managers to be able to track my progress and make sure they're happy with what I am doing. 
* ❌ I am going to try to say no to unimportant meetings and understand the value behind my time. 
* ✔ I am also going to try and be critical with my review of the code I am writing and questioning efficency as I am learning that with C# there are a **lot** of really cool things that you can do with LINQ and T classes.

2/3 isn't bad but I have my reasons. With the whole meeting side of things, I have decided that no matter what I do this year, it is going to be a learning experience. That includes being trapped in boring long meetings 😂. I however have taken steps to leavng meetings that aren't relevant and also gone to lengths to be invited to meetings that I don't need to be in to understand why that meeting is happening in the first place and it has given me a lot of buisness insight. 

My goals for work at the moment are set quarterly and seem as though last quarters goal was get something in to production, this quarters goals are more substantial, including:

* _Confirm and implement the architecture I suggest for my project_ 
* _Teach a lunch& learn about the system I am developing_
* _Take the role Scrum Master for a sprint_

## 👷‍♂️The job

I am still loving the job, the company and the work I am doing. Getting to speak to people within and outside the company to discover the need for the work I am doing and having a deliverable piece of software at the end of each sprint has been so fulfilling and I can whole heartedly say that I am in love ♥ with the work. It doesn't feel like a job and so when the money at the end of each month comes in I am somewhat supprised as I don't feel like I have worked, I feel like I have done what I love doing... Coding!  

I had a meeting with the Managing director of the company and talked a great length about how much I am enjoying the job, the current work I am doing (which sadly I can't say too much about as it's super secret 🤫) and about ham... If you know, you know how weird and wonderful the ham saga is. 

I also have had a call from the operations director commending me for my work and have also closed a HELL of a lot more tickets 🎟.

## 🏠The big move

Moving down south has been weird though, being able to start to see people as lockdown is eased made me feel so appreciative of them but as quickly as it came, so did the moving date. It was a stressful time 💥 but I got a chance to stay with family and really start to discover that the south isn't as bad as northerers make it out to be. It's strange not knowing anyone but I have seen collegues and friends and I try to get out everyday, even if it's just going to the shop. 🛒

Brighton is a beautiful city 😍 with a real atomosphere of energy about it, there are so many different kinds of people and no matter who you are, you are accepted here. 

I am looking forward to meeting more awesome people, getting out there more and also spending time with my southern family! 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦

With all that said, I look forward to updating you with the fun things I get up to and thank you for reading! 

Tom 😎
